# my-custom-rules

This is an example of a public repo with semgrep rules.
After a change, they are published automatically to the semgrep instance (thanks to the `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`).

The Python script `put_rules_in_mode.py` helps you put the rules in a given policy and mode: Monitor, Commnent, or Block.
